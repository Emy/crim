# Contributing to Crim
Community involvement is appreaciated and welcomed with open arms. There are specific requirements that must be met, but they're not too unreasonable.

If you have any questions or concerns, you can can either
- Email [Emy](mailto:me@emy.moe) about your issue/question, or..
- Open a discussion on Github. You might get answers from others this way.

## Submitting an Issue
Any issues with the project itself and its functionality can be reported using the issue templates provided to you when submitting an issue — issues which don't follow a specific template will be closed and marked as invalid.

## Contribution Process
1. Fork the project, and make changes revelant to what you're trying to change. Please do this in a different branch in your fork — it's a lot easier this way
2. Create a Pull Request on Github detailing your change. Your changes must be tested before submitting a Pull Request
3. Test your changes on your own instance of the project and post some kind of evidence that your changes work. On top of that, make sure that your linter is happy with you — untested changes will be denied

Don't expect your changes to be pushed to upstream automatically — your changes must be reviewed in case there's a few bugs with your changes.

Once further changes (from possible reviews of your code) have been met, your changes will be merged to upstream and the global project instance will be updated.
